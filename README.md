# dFurnitureEditor

Staff pick as of: 2016/07/12 13:01:15 UTC-07:00 (65 days and 2 hours ago)

Denizen Version: Release Build #1622 

Script Version: 0.7 

Description:

dFurnitureEditor is an inventory GUI based furniture editor (surprise!).
It lets you create and remove props, as well as add and tweak their components, without even needing to open a script file. This is all done thanks to armor stands, and can the changes made are available right as you made them. No need for reloads.
Right now prop parts have 6 available values: their offset position relative to the prop center, their rotation angles, wether or not they are small (small armor stands render smaller items), the item they hold, wether or not the player can sit on them and wether or not they emit fire particles.
Also, it comes with a sample stool and log :D
It still lacks polishing and documentation, and I'll most likely add more utilities to it as time progresses.
For any questions regarding this script, or anything else, feel free to ping me in the IRC.
Usage:

/dfe edit *opens the editor GUI

/dfe place Stool *places the prop named Stool at your current location

/dfe remove Stool *removes the Stool at your current location
